# SAT #1 - Starbursting

# SAT: Starbursting

## "**Starbursting** is a brainstorming technique that focuses on generating questions rather than eliciting ideas or answers. It uses the six questions commonly asked by journalists: Who? What? How? When? Where? and Why?"

# SAT #2 - Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)

# SAT: Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)

## "**Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)** is an analytic process that identifies a complete set of alternative hypotheses, systematically evaluates data that are consistent or inconsistent with each hypothesis, and proceeds by rejecting hypotheses rather than trying to confirm what appears to be the most likely hypotheses."

# SAT #3 - Key Assumptions Check

# SAT: Key Assumptions Check

## "The **Key Assumptions Check** is a systematic effort to make explit and question the assumptions (the mental model) that guide an analysts interpretation of evidence and reasoning about any particular problem."

# Take Aways

- LLMs are not a replacement for Analysts
- Let computers do computer things, let humans do human things, and figure out they work together
- Experimentation is always better than theory
- An AI system doesn't have to be better than a human, just better than the best available human
