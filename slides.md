# The Problem

# SATs are hard to learn, hard to use, hard to teach, work best in teams, and take too long to execute effectively.

# SAT: Starbursting

## "**Starbursting** is a brainstorming technique that focuses on generating questions rather than eliciting ideas or answers. It uses the six questions commonly asked by journalists: Who? What? How? When? Where? and Why?"

# Starbursting

- Built a Streamlit app to run the Starbursting SAT
- Zero shot based on the SAT
    - Given a scenario, generate questions for who, what, when, where, why, and how
- Output a JSON file with the results for human review
- **Test Case:** A ransomware attack on a hospital

# SAT: Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)

## "**Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)** is an analytic process that identifies a complete set of alternative hypotheses, systematically evaluates data that are consistent or inconsistent with each hypothesis, and proceeds by rejecting hypotheses rather than trying to confirm what appears to be the most likely hypotheses."

### ~ Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis by Heuer & Pherson

<!-- A Hypothesis Generation and Testing technique -->

---
title: ACH
---

# Analysis of Competing Hypotheses

- Built a Streamlit app to run the ACH SAT
- Multi stage process based on the SAT
    - Accepts a complex question
    - First API Call: Generate a list of hypotheses
    - Second Set of API Calls: Generate a list of evidence for/against each hypothesis
    - Third Set of API Calls: Score each hypothesis based on the evidence
- Ouput a CSV file with the results for human review
- **Test Case:** Who was behind the XZ backdoor?

# SAT: Key Assumptions Check

## "The **Key Assumptions Check** is a systematic effort to make explit and question the assumptions (the mental model) that guide an analysts interpretation of evidence and reasoning about any particular problem."

# Key Assumptions Check

- Built a Streamlit app to run the Key Assumptions Check SAT
    - Accepts a PDF file, extracts text
    - Zero-shot classification of the text
    - Generates a list of key assumptions
- **Test Case:** [Strider Technologies - Inside the Shadow Network](https://content.striderintel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Strider-Inside-Shadow-Network-Report.pdf)
    - The report is about North Korean IT workers and their involvement in cybercrime

# Key Assumptions Check

- The document assumes that IT workers are involved in the manipulation of cryptocurrency markets, including the use of malware to mine cryptocurrencies.
- The document assumes that North Korean IT workers are dispatched abroad to countries like the PRC, Russia, Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.
- The document assumes that North Korean IT workers are involved in cybercrime activities such as hacking, ransomware deployment, and intellectual property theft.
- The document assumes that North Korean IT workers are using false identities and front companies to infiltrate Western businesses.
- The document assumes that PRC-based entities are involved in shipping equipment for DPRK remote workers.
- The document assumes that PRC-based front companies are facilitating the global operations of fraudulent North Korean IT workers.

# AI â†’ IA
## Artificial Intelligence to Intelligence Augmentation


---

# Take Aways

- LLMs are not a replacement for Analysts
- Let computers do computer things, let humans do human things, and figure out they work together
- Experimentation is always better than theory
- An AI system doesn't have to be better than a human, just better than the best available human
